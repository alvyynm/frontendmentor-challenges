## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main takeaway from this project was the importance of mobile-first workflow. It helped me save time. Since the design is identical on mobile and desktop, all I had to do was design the mobile site, and voila!

The second takeaway is how to use overlay effects

### Continued development

Here are the main areas I plan to improve on:

- Mobile-first workflow
- Planning for the structure ahead of time
- Aligning images inside a div without overflow
- Using overlay effects
- Z-index
